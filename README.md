bbb-ipd-vcf
===========

Quick &amp; dirty scripts to convert Address Book (Contacts list) from
BlackBerry .bbb/.ipd backup (BB Desktop Software 7.1) to
vCard .vcf files (for Android &amp; other civilized phones).


Procedure
---------

1. Install Lua (http://lua.org) and Go (http://golang.org).
2. Rename `BlackBerry Bold 9780 (08-12-2013).bbb` to `backup.zip`.
3. Unpack `backup.zip`.
4. In file `Manifest.xml`, find fragment like this: `<Database uid="125" recordcount="509">Address Book - All</Database>`, then note the `uid` value (here: 125).
5. Find `uid` .dat file, e.g. `Databases\125.dat` (this is actually an .ipd formatted file).
6. Run: `lua ipd2xml.lua 125.dat | go run xml2vcf.go > contacts.vcf`.
