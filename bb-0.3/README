This is a Blackberry IPD editor, most useful for editing service books.  It can
convert an IPD to XML and back.  To make the XML more human readable, XSLT is
used to translate fields to known names.  Unfortunately the human readable XMLs
cannot be edited yet because someone needs to write "reverse" XSLTs (actually,
it's very simple).  Thus, the intended use is to generate the human readable XML
to see what to change, and then change it in the hex XML manually.  

Apart from editing existing service book entries, this can be used to merge
service books, delete entries, and add new ones.  (For some reason, by browsing
on the Internet one can see much demand for this, though a lack of a tool that
implements this rather trivial functionality.)

This tool purposely has no GUI to keep it as simple and "stable" as possible.  A
frontend GUI for editing the XML can be developed.

Usage:
bb -i backup.ipd -o backup.xml 
bb -i backup.xml -o backup2.ipd
md5sum backup.ipd backup2.ipd 

For human readable output try:
bb -i backup.ipd -o backup.xml -x sb.xsl -x sb2.xsl -x hrt.xsl 

If adventurous, add this to the previous command line:
-x app.xsl -x app2.xsl

This software was tested on Linux, with IPDs from a Vodafone UK Bold, grabbed
from Blackberry Desktop Manager 4.7.
